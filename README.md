## MVP

To reach MVP, this project will need:

 - The ability for a user to submit issues
 - A System for differentiating users and admins
 - A database for containing issues and related properties
 - The ability for an admin to RUD data

## Stretch Goals

If time permits it, I would like to add:

 - A responsive design
 - Ability to set priority of issues as an admin, and sort issues by it
 - A system for users to track submitted issues
 - Display of user OAuth profiles in admin view

## Tech Stack

 - HTML, CSS, JS
 - Node.js, Express.js, OAuth, MongoDB, Mongoose
 - VSCodium


## Potential Roadblocks
The biggest difficulties in this project are likely to be:

 - Differentiation of users and admins
 - Implementation of OAuth
